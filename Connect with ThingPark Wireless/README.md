# Tutorial 1: Connect with ThingPark Wireless

Exists two different ways to get devices data from Actility ThingPark servers. The first one is using an AS routing profile, which gives users the opportunity to send data to any HTTP server, with the constrain that this data will be encoded by an algorithm made by the device maker. To solve this problem, Actility gives the opportunity to use the DX-API Dataflow as well, which is a software that allows subscribers to manage their ThingPark account and create new connectors called “Dataflows”. These Dataflows send data in the same way of an AS Routing Profile but manage different protocols (Besides HTTP), could use keys and certificates to make a more secure connection and decode your device data to send ready to process information to your application server.

Here you will find two folders which includes tutorials about how to use these two ways.
